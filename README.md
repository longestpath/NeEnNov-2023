# NeEnNov-2023

In need of a short daily practice, I considered doing [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/about-nano) to work on some stories in my DnD campaign setting, but novel writing isn't really my thing. So, this [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/) came across my feeds and it seemed to make a lot of sense!

So, introductin my repository for what I'm calling New Engine November (NeEnNov)!
